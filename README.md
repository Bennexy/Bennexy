## I'm currently working on 
1. Writing a redis server from scratch!
Checkout my repo [here](https://github.com/Bennexy/codecrafters-redis-rust)!

2. Setting up my privatly hosted dream setup. This includes:
- my own [docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry)
- a docker registry ui using [joxit/docker-registry-ui](https://joxit.dev/docker-registry-ui/)
- own dns server using [unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/)
- [Pi hole](https://pi-hole.net/)
- A custom [FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) build, tunneling into my self hosted network without exposing any ports
- Custom CA certificate management using openssl tooling
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik) as a loadbalancer
- [Bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) for private documentation

All servers are 100% dockerized and stored in my private docker registry as well as (partialy) on dockerhub -> find me [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/bennexy)!

3. Expanding into new fields!
I always do, i just enjoy the challenge and gaining new knowledge :D.
